            <p>The five major symbols recognised in the church for reconciliation are Keys, Purple Stole, Raised Hand, Sign of the Cross and a Scourging Whip. The Keys crossed in the shape of an X is the more commonly known symbol for the Sacrament of Reconciliation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>1. <b>The Sacrament of Confession:</b> This sacrament is also known as the Sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation. It involves confession before the priest, obtaining absolution, and doing the penance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2. <b>The Crucifix:</b> The crucifix is a sign or signal of the very resurrection of Christ in terms of sacrifice and forgiveness. As such, it became a sign or signal for reconciliation between God and humankind.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. <b>The Sign of the Cross:</b> It is a gesture performed both at the beginning and at the end of confession and signifies the reconciliation of the penitent to God because of the grace from the sacrifice of Christ.</p>
            <br>
            <p>4. <b>The Stole:</b> The use of a stole at confession suggests that the priest acts as an intermediary between God and the penitent.</p>
            <br>
            <p>5. <b>The White Garment:</b> In some traditions, white vestments are worn or used symbolically to express the purity and forgiveness obtained through reconciliation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>6. <b>The Keys:</b> Symbolic of the authority given by Christ to the Church to bind and loose sins according to Matthew 16:19.</p>
